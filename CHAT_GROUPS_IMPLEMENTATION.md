# Chat Groups Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds chat group functionality to the TBS application, allowing users to have context-aware conversations in different business areas: Innovation, Operations, and Growth.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Chat Group Selector Component (`components/chat-group-selector.tsx`)
- **Innovation Group**: Focus on creative problem-solving, R&D, and breakthrough thinking
- **Operations Group**: Focus on process optimization, efficiency, and day-to-day management  
- **Growth Group**: Focus on business scaling, marketing, and revenue growth
- Clean, modern UI with icons and descriptions for each group
- Responsive design with hover states and selection indicators

### 2. Updated Chat Page (`app/(dashboard)/chat/page.tsx`)
- Added sidebar with group selector
- Integrated group selection state management
- Passes selected group to chat component
- Maintains existing document management functionality

### 3. Enhanced Chat Component (`components/realtime-chat-gemini.tsx`)
- Added `selectedGroup` prop to component interface
- Passes group context to API calls
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality

### 4. API Integration (`app/api/gemini/route.ts`)
- Added group-specific context to AI responses
- Each group has tailored instructions and response styles:
  - **Innovation**: Creative, forward-thinking, encourages bold ideas
  - **Operations**: Practical, systematic, results-focused
  - **Growth**: Strategic, market-oriented, growth-focused
- Updated database operations to store group information
- Enhanced system prompts with group-specific context

### 5. Database Schema (`supabase/migrations/20241220_add_chat_groups.sql`)
- Added `group_type` column to `chat_history` table
- Constraint to ensure only valid groups ('innovation', 'operations', 'growth')
- Indexes for performance optimization
- Default value of 'innovation' for existing records

## Technical Implementation Details

- Emphasize scalability and sustainability
- Focus on metrics and ROI
- Be market-oriented and customer-centric
```

### Database Integration
- Group information is stored with each chat instance

### UI/UX Design
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Clean, modern interface with Tailwind CSS
- Intuitive group selection with visual feedback
