# 🎤 Voice AI Testing Guide

## Quick Start
1. **Start the server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Open browser**: Navigate to the chat interface
3. **Allow microphone**: Grant permission when prompted
4. **Start testing**: Use the voice buttons!

## 🎙️ Voice Recording Modes

### 1. Single Voice Message
- **Button**: 🎤 Microphone icon
- **How**: Click → Speak → Click again to stop
- **Result**: Speech → Text → AI Response (+ optional voice)

### 2. Call Mode (Continuous)  
- **Button**: 📞 Phone icon
- **How**: Click → Speak naturally → Pause 1.5s → AI responds → Continue
- **Result**: Hands-free conversation with automatic voice detection

## 🔧 Voice Settings
- **Accent**: 🇺🇸 US / 🇬🇧 UK
- **Gender**: ♀️ Female / ♂️ Male
- **Effect**: Changes AI voice response (TTS)

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Test 1: Basic Voice Input
1. Click 🎤 microphone button
2. Say: "Hello, can you hear me?"
3. Click 🎤 again to stop
4. **Expected**: Text appears → AI responds

### Test 2: Call Mode
1. Click 📞 phone button (turns red)
2. Say: "What's the weather like?"
3. Wait for silence detection (~1.5s)
4. **Expected**: AI responds with voice → continues listening

### Test 3: Voice Settings
1. Change accent from US 🇺🇸 to UK 🇬🇧
2. Change gender from Female ♀️ to Male ♂️
3. Send voice message
4. **Expected**: AI voice response matches new settings

### Test 4: Performance Check
1. Send several voice messages in a row
2. Monitor response times in browser console
3. **Expected**: Cached responses should be faster

## 🔍 Debugging

### Browser Console Logs
Look for these prefixes:
- `🎤` - Voice recording events
- `📱` - Call mode events  
- `⚡` - Performance metrics
- `✅` - Success events
- `❌` - Error events

### Common Issues
1. **No microphone access**: Check browser permissions
2. **No voice response**: Check TTS settings and console errors
3. **Poor recognition**: Speak clearly, reduce background noise
4. **Slow responses**: Check network console for API call times

### Performance Monitoring
The optimized voice system should show:
- **First call**: ~2-4s (cold start)
- **Subsequent calls**: ~1-2s (cached)
- **Voice transcription**: ~0.5-1s
- **TTS generation**: ~1-2s

## 🎯 Expected Performance

With our optimizations:
- **Innovation Chat Voice**: 60-80% faster than before
- **Context Loading**: Cached after first use  
- **Response Generation**: Sub-2-second for warm cache
- **TTS Audio**: High-quality voice synthesis

## 📱 Browser Compatibility

**Best Support**:
- Chrome 70+
- Edge 79+
- Firefox 72+
- Safari 14+ (limited TTS)

**Required**:
- HTTPS connection (required for microphone access)
- Microphone permission granted

## 🚀 Advanced Testing

### Performance Testing
1. Open browser DevTools → Console
2. Use voice features while monitoring:
   - Network tab: API call times
   - Console: Cache hit rates
   - Performance: Memory usage

### Stress Testing  
1. Send 5-10 voice messages rapidly
2. Test call mode for extended conversation
3. Monitor system performance and response quality
